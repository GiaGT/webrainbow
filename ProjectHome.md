# Control your Led Matrix over the web! #

webRainbow uses an Arduino (or seeeduino or compatible devices) with an Ethernet Shield, to control one or more 8x8 RGB Led Matrix (rainbowduino) from the web. The project uses xHTML and Javascript for the frontend, PHP to communicate with the Arduinos (with the Ethernet Connection), and i2C for the communication between the Arduino and the Led Matrix.

The package include all the software needed to build the project: a customized arduino's firmware a new raibowduino's firmware and the php program.

The first beta version will be available soon.
(The development source code is now available from svn).
Stay tuned!
